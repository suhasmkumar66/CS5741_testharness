**TestHarness**

main.go script will run 6 tests, each test will be looped 10 times and the average time for test is calculated

TestHarness will output the average time for each test as well as the total time (sum of all the average times of each test).
If the result produced by your algorithm does not match the result matrix, then test is failed

**Rules are as follows:**
1. You **can only Modify your code in multiply()** function and the other functions that you create
2. You cannot modify the signature of multiply() function
3. You cannot use any external libraries
4. You have to pass all the 6 tests in order to remain in the competition
5. You can come prepared with your code on the day of competition(No need to write the code during competition) and give your code either in pendrive or mail committee members
6. Once all the tests are passed your execution time will be noted by committee members

There are two files in matrices folder:
1. matrices.go which contains 12 matrices (M0 to M11)
2. results.go which contains results of matrices (R01 to R1011)
   
The result generated from your algorithm/code will be compared to the generated results(results.go)
